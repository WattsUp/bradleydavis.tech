    <h2>Hardware Engineering Intern</h2>
    <h5>May 2018 - Present // Pullman, WA</h5>
    <p><a class="icon-link external" href="https://selinc.com/solutions/rugged-computers/"></a></p>
    <p>I joined SEL's <i>Automation Platforms</i> group at the end of my freshman year of college. My teamâ€™s primary
      product in development is an Intel computer designed for rugged environments, the <a
        href="http://selinc.com/products/3350/">SEL-3350</a> pictured below. It is a 100% passively cooled computer that
      runs software to communicate to relays, automation controllers, and any other smart grid equipment. Quickly after
      catching my bearings, I was assigned the task of redesigning software used to test Ethernet ports on these
      computers we create. With a loose set of requirements, I refined the goal and began developing the software. The
      final product, written in C++, tests up to ten ports each running at gigabit speeds and can interface in either
      loopback mode or with an auxiliary unit. It is being used extensively in functional and type testing and has
      received positive feedback from the technicians.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Following the Ethernet software, my contributions towards this product include debugging and presenting fixes to
      electrical bugs. Beyond the initial board bring-up, I regularly execute functional tests to validate the operation
      of the various circuits. With that comes writing testing plans, using testing tools such as oscilloscopes and
      Ethernet packet sniffers, documenting and defending results of the tests, and developing solutions to failed test
      cases. I have also executed and supported various compliance type tests including surge, EFTB, radiated immunity,
      thermal cycling, & dielectric strength. These tight regulatory specifications often require extensive
      troubleshooting to identify root cause of the failing test.</p>
    <p>A hardware project I lead from conception to release was an experiment of a high surge withstanding Gigabit
      Ethernet interface. The IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard specifies an isolation requirement of 1500V between a device
      and a copper Ethernet cable. For most cables runs that need higher requirements (encountered from lightning
      strikes) fiber optic cables are used. Some applications prefer copper cables for various reasons which is where
      this project comes in. This project included reading regulations to determine proper surge levels, developing a
      circuit to survive such a violent impulse, validating Ethernet timing, and executing destructive surge testing to
      determine limits. To complete this endeavor, I wrote a whitepaper about the project and I presented my results to
      managers to discuss the commercial adoption of this circuit.</p>
    <p>Another project I ran with addressed an issue in manufacturing that resulted in damage to the assembled unit and
      a hazardous condition to the assemblers. I spent time exploring the root cause of the issue and presenting some
      possible fixes to manufacturing. Deciding on a testing tool, I developed a PCB using <a
        href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/">Autodesk EAGLE</a> and a CNC router with tight restrictions on
      size, ease of use, and reliability. The tester has been in use for years and has caught many defects saving money
      and life.</p>
    <p>Due to ordinary end-of-life notices or extraordinary circumstances (COVID impacted supply chain) alternate parts
      need to be identified and qualified to maintain uninterrupted product manufacturing. I have handled many of these
      alternates, most of which is writing documentation comparing the alternate to the original and coordinating with
      all groups impacted by the change. Some work is done by obtaining samples and testing performance in every product
      that uses it.</p>
    <p>In my group, and specifically a team of four engineers, we utilize an agile methodology. I have become accustomed
      to using <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a> to track my tasks and analyze future work. I am
      also well familiarized with the rituals of agile: sprint planning, stand-ups, and retrospectives.</p>
