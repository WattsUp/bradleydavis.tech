    <h2>Lead Technical Counselor</h2>
    <h5>June 2014 - June 2018 // Maple Valley, WA</h5>
    <p><a class="icon-link github" href="https://github.com/WattsUp/Mallard-Madness"></a><a class="icon-link external"
        href="http://tahomarobotics.org"></a></p>
    <p>Since 2012, Tahoma Robotics Club host a week-long summer camp for ages 8 to 14. Starting in 2018, they extended
      the number of weeks they run due to high demand. Campers build <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/">VEX</a>
      robots for four days then compete in a competition on the last day with their family and friends cheering them
      on.</p>
    <p><b>2014, Round Up:</b> I joined the counselors in 2014 with a focus in creating robot designs for the younger
      campers to follow and helping with the electronics and programming. Teams could choose between several different
      chassis and manipulators then we would help them realize their plan. The older and more adventurous teams could
      dream of any design and build it.</p>
    <p><b>2015, Bridge Battle:</b> For my second year working for the camp, I designed the game than the campers would
      compete in by tweaking an existing VEX game. I also did the previous duties of designing robot templates,
      electronics, and programming. For the competition, I improved the production quality by creating a highlight
      video presented to the families showing what their campers were learning and accomplishing over the week.</p>

      <b>2016, Wiffle Piffle:</b> This time I created the entire game from scratch. This entailed designing game
      elements, writing rules, creating a game animation, testing gameplay to ensure balance amongst various levels of
      competition, and manufacturing custom trophies. Since the game was unique, I could not use the VEX tournament
      software to run the scoring. I had to write a custom program that handled all the required functions: match
      scoring, team ranking, alliance selection, elimination bracket, and more. If that wasn’t enough work, I also
      improved competition day production value by developing a livestreaming solution. Family and friends that could
      not attend the competition locally could tune in to the livestream and watch their campers compete.</p>
    <p class="clearfix"><img class="right lazy" alt="Logo for robotics summer camp, Flag Frenzy"
        title="Flag Frenzy logo" src="flag-frenzy_lazy.png">
      <b>2017, Flag Frenzy:</b> Once again I developed a unique game with all of the associated components. I did
      improve my animation skills which resulted in a much higher quality game animation although I no longer have the
      video to share. Inspired by capture the flag, robots pushed flags around the field and increased the flag’s point
      value with ping pong balls.</p>

        title="Mallard Madness elimination bracket" src="mallard-madness_lazy.png">
      <b>2018, Mallard Madness:</b> Despite being away in college, the camp wanted me to create another game. This time:
      rubber ducks and milk crates. My animation skills improved as well, and I have the <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUJoUvNho0A">video</a>. This year I posted all of the resources required
      to run the game on <a href="https://github.com/WattsUp/Mallard-Madness">Github</a> for other robotics camps to
      utilize. I travelled to the first week of the camp to ensure the game went smoothly and to train my replacement
      for the following weeks and years. For a sample of the real-time tournament software, check out the <a
