      <p><a class="icon-link external" href="https://tahomarobotics.org/"></a></p>
      <p>Since 2007, Bear Metal has participated in <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics
          Competition</a>. FRC is an engineering sport where teams from around the world are given six weeks to
        strategize, design, fabricate, assemble, wire, program, and practice a human-sized robot. These robots are then
        pitted against each other by playing a game that changes every year. My brother joined Bear Metal for their 2009
        season. Every chance I got, I would visit their shop and learn how to build robots. In 2012, I was finally old
        enough, despite being in middle school, to help the high school team.</p>

        <p><b>2017, Hindenbearg:</b> Senior year for me meant this had to be the best robot I’ve designed. <i>Spoiler:
            it was</i>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Steamworks">Steamworks</a>, a steampunk theme,
          meant the robot had to collect fuel, <i>wiffle balls</i>, to put them in a boiler then climb onto an airship
          once the propellers had enough gears to spin up. Our robot's chassis was fast by having the maximum number of
          high-power motors attached. Both the fuel collector and the gear collector were incredibly effective. The
          double wide shooter, guided by camera, could propel 10 fuel every second into the 8 feet tall boiler. The
          climber’s spinning hook side Velcro drum fastened to fibrous rope and lifted the entire robot to reveal my
          Easter egg: the bottom of the robot was the team’s logo which could only revealed with a successful climb.</p>

      <p class="clearfix">At least 2000 parts, from frame members to motors to bolts to electronics to zip ties, were
        CADed in <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/">Autodesk Inventor</a>. 90% of that work was my
        doing over the first 18 days of build season. Once the design started being fabricated by our in-house CNC
        mills, I moved to rendering a preview. I spent countless hours adjusting materials, lighting, and settings to
        achieve the photorealistic render. Except as my worst critic, I see areas for improvement now two years later.

        <p><b>2016, Xcalibear:</b> FIRST decided to make every game themed. 2016 was the first and they picked <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Stronghold">medieval times</a>. The robots had to scramble over
          moats, across rubble, and through a portcullis to reach a castle then throw boulders to destroy the tower. Our
          response had a fitting name: a pun of Excalibur whilst dropping the <i>E</i> to accent that it was our tenth
          robot. I had initial trouble designing the chassis, but the final version was excellent at traversing any
          obstacles with its 8 inch pneumatic wheels and dual speed gearboxes.</p>

        fun to design. It articulated up, down, and middle with its triple position pneumatic cylinders. It had a
        separately articulated set of wheels and conveyor belts which swiftly grabbed any boulder in the vicinity. At
        the world competition, we figured out how to climb using a telescopic arm and a hook. This was another time
        where we could always climb in practice but rarely could during the matches. This was my first year spending
        significant time on photorealistic rendering. Albeit my first time, the resulting image turned out better than
        expected.</p>

        <p><b>2015, Maverick:</b> My first robot as the design lead, also our first powdered coated robot.
          <i>Coincidence? I think not.</i> This attractive robot played an interesting <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycle_Rush">game</a> that involved stacking totes and filling
          recycling containers with pool noodles. <i>I did say interesting</i>. I had fun with the chassis, it was our
          first robot that could drive sideways! By utilizing an H drive, it could precisely position to align with the
          totes quickly. The lift made Maverick the one of the tallest robots we have made. Plus, with a pneumatic
          actuated rake that slammed down on the recycling containers, it was our longest robot. In my opinion, the rake
          (not pictured) made this robot the most dangerous and intimidating machine in our collection.</p>

      <p><b>2014, Bearium:</b> Sort of like volleyball but with exercise balls: <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_Assist">Aerial Assist</a>. Our approach resulted in one of our
        scariest robots, but also so cool. The catapult was my task as the assistant design lead. It had massive
        springs, winched back by a gearbox with a pneumatic clutch, and adjustable range control using over-centered
        cams. Its performance was excellent, but the overall robot suffered from its poor collector and intermittent
        electrical faults. This robot taught me that the electronics need to be designed robustly and have easy access
        for fault troubleshooting, which I have followed ever since.</p>

        <p><b>2013, Bearodactyl:</b> This was an exciting <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Ascent">game</a> with an enlightening robot. The goal was to
          throw frisbees into boxes on the wall and to climb a 10 feet tall pyramid. Our robot’s strategy was to do
          every task possible in the game. My main contribution was on the climber which gave the robot its name by
          climbing with claws. I designed various components and after many hours of troubleshooting, it climbed. Check
          out a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_20W7T2AU9I">video</a> of it working in practice. Somehow
          successful practice did not result in successful matches. Poor performance in competition taught the team
          about how the “do all” strategy isn’t always the best.</p>

        basketball game with tilting bridges. As this was my first official year, I did the usual first year duties:
        deburring, sanding, cutting stock, etc. It was a while ago, so I don’t remember exactly what I did; though, I do
        remember designing part of the robot’s turret and machining out some parts on the CNC mill.</p>
