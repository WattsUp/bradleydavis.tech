      <h4>All You Knead is Loaf</h4>
      <h5>Bread is Forking Delicious</h5>
      <p>Grab a large Pyrex glass bowl, at least four liters large. Add 350mL of warm water about 45° Celsius. 7 grams
        of active dry yeast<sup><a href="#cite-note-1" id="cite-ref-1">[1]</a></sup>, 13 grams of sugar. Mix. Let sit
        for five minutes. Lean in and waft. That is the aroma of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> digesting the sugar and
        excreting alcohol and carbon dioxide. A scent so distinct we use it to describe other substances. Atop the
        liquid skims a layer of froth. Firm, it forms a protective shield for the young single-celled fungi to ferment
        and reproduce.</p>
      <p>Add and mix 14 grams of salt. 3 grams of rosemary. 500 grams of flour<sup><a href="#cite-note-2"
            id="cite-ref-2">[2]</a></sup>. Whilst enhancing the flavor of the bread, the salt regulates the rate of
        yeast activity. Too much or too little can lead to a final good that lacks structure. Again, lean in and waft.
        The distinct fragrance of rosemary accents the yeast excretions. With the right amount of flour, what was once
        liquid becomes a soft mass with a clay-like texture<sup><a href="#cite-note-3" id="cite-ref-3">[3]</a></sup>.
        Soft, sticky, course, and shaggy. It lacks a cohesive quality, requiring more work to form the infamous texture
        of bread dough.</p>
      <p>Empty the dough onto a counter dusted with flour. Begin to knead the dough. <i>Fold, press, rotate.</i>
        <i>Fold, press, rotate.</i> As you continue for several minutes, notice how the irregularities in the texture
        begin the smooth out. The gluten starts dispersed and mangled. <i>Fold, press, rotate.</i> They align, forming
        long chains of amino acid. This structure is durable, yet pliable. <i>Fold, press, rotate.</i> The air bubbles
        introduced from the process and the gas from the fermenting yeast become trapped in pockets surrounded by gluten
        rich dough. <i>Fold, press, rotate.</i> Once the dough is soft, asking to be used as a pillow, kneading is
        complete. Place it in a large bowl lightly greased, then cover with a moist towel.</p>
      <p>Check on the dough occasionally. Rising in a warm environment is the quickest path to finished bread, yet a
        cooler environment fostering a slower rise yields more flavor<sup><a href="#cite-note-4"
            id="cite-ref-4">[4]</a></sup>. The yeast has more time to produce the rich palpable taste of bread. The
        dough is resilient, it will double in size at some point yielding only for a catastrophic baking disaster.</p>
      <p>Once the dough has doubled in size, it acts like a heavy balloon. The trapped air is only a thin layer away
        from escaping. Firmly poke the top. <i>Pop, whoosh.</i> The dome collapses with a gentle exhale. Move the dough
        to the counter and knead it a couple of cycles. <i>Fold, press, rotate.</i> This redistributes the warmth,
        breaks up yeast clusters, and releases the toxic alcohol. Plop it into a lightly greased loaf pan and let rise
        again. To avoid over or under proofing, check-up often. It should increase in volume by only half this time.
        Push firmly on the top. There should be some resistance as the gluten stretches like a water balloon, but not
        too much that the center feels dense. Lastly, poke the loaf and observe that it forms a dent then disappears in
        a few seconds.</p>
      <p>Preheat the oven to 210° Celsius. Place the loaf on the lowest rack. As the heat encroaches on the yeasts’
        territory, they once again increase their fermentation rate. More trapped gas leads to the final spring in
        volume. Confined by the loaf pan, the mound bulges over the edge, the iconic bread outline takes shape. After
        fifteen minutes, open the oven for a bit. Steam and heat escape, carrying the aroma of bread. <i>Ahhhhhh</i>, as
        primal human nature takes over: euphoria. This action allows the outer surface to begin to dehydrate forming
        crust. The yeast has perished by this time from the heat. The bread begins to enter its final form. </p>
      <p>Ten more minutes<sup><a href="#cite-note-5" id="cite-ref-5">[5]</a></sup>. Remove from the scorching enclosure.
        Inspect a golden-brown outer shell. Hard and stiff, it maintains the structure as the loaf is removed from its
        pan. The kitchen becomes saturated with the smell of bread. Knock on the top. Listen to the hollowness
        echo<sup><a href="#cite-note-6" id="cite-ref-6">[6]</a></sup>. Feel the warmth seep in. A large bread knife with
        deep serrations is best for slicing. The teeth rattle on the top until they take bite and carve off a piece.
        More steam escapes without the crust to hold back. A butter knife spreads dairy goodness atop. Melting from the
        heat, it flows into the spongy texture. Take a bite. The tongue explores the butter filled craters, the crispy
        and crunchy walls, the crumbs that begin to flee. This is what hours of rising was all for.</p>
      <p>All through human development, we reach for help from parents, caretakers, family, friends, and others. They
        are our bakers. Adding just the right amount of ingredients. Kneading until silky smooth. Providing a safe and
        warm environment to rise to our fullest potential. Beginning as a single cell, fragile and new to the world, a
        fertilized egg hopes to undergo mitosis repeatedly until the construction of organic material becomes a fetus.
        During this feeble stage, the brood seek their caretaker for nourishment and protection. Embedded in our
        mother’s uterus and attached by an umbilical, she breathes for us, eats for us, walks for us. This symbiosis is
        the first relationship of our existence and often remains powerful throughout life, only ceasing with
        death<sup><a href="#cite-note-7" id="cite-ref-7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
      <p>For years following birth, even decades, human children remain abreast with their mother. As time progresses,
        the caretaking role diminishes, and the infant learns self-sufficient qualities and complex thoughts and
        emotions. Philosophers<sup><a href="#cite-note-8" id="cite-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> argued that at birth infants are
        born with a <i>Tabula Rasa</i>, blank state in English. Only enough knowledge how to sustain life such as
        breathing, all that which makes us human is a result of our rearing. Our nurturing is the dominate influencer of
        personality and that nature, genealogy, has minimal impact. This view places a significant burden on parenting.
      </p>
      <p>Parents provide this personality molding at a young age, setting the tone for further development in a child’s
        life. The use of games to teach social interactions and skills such as truth, patience, teamwork, communication,
        and conflict resolution is often used once children learn how to talk. Adults likely woe the opportunity to play
        <i>duck, duck, goose</i> for the fifteenth time that day. Their children, young and innocent, ask endlessly to
        subtlety learn how to assess others, targeting those who are least attentive for the best chance to avoid being
        tagged. These games primarily take on a everybody wins mentality, or the elder participants will reduce their
        effort and involvement to allow the young to win. Building a desire to play based on the jubilation of winning
        allows more complex games to be played without discouragement. Then the effort restores to a more competitive
        level to foster sportsmanship. That joy wasn’t from winning but instead playing a fun game with others who care
        for you.</p>
      <p>Enriched with continuous learning, the mind grows from these experiences. Adding fragments of personality
        traits to one’s once blank slate. If this state of innocence is hastened or prolonged, difficulties later in
        life emerge. Traumatic experiences quickly take hold of innocence and embeds conscious and subconscious feelings
        that greatly affect one’s personality. Most serial killers suffered some type of maltreatment during childhood.
        On the other hand, children with overly protective parents that maintain their innocence for as long as possible
        can foster feelings of shame or self-doubt and inability to express oneself without feeling anxious. As with
        most things, life is a careful balance of various factors. Too much or too little and all hell breaks loose.
        Hopefully during development, these narrow margins widen to allow larger swings of stimuli. A physical analog to
        emotional hardening, a small amount of foreign material from a vaccine allows the immune system to prepare a
        defence against a real attack in the future. Sometimes these experiences are too much to handle and one’s mental
        state deflates to a low. Family and friends help to mend the holes, allowing oneself to rebuild the mind. This
        restored mental state has improved structure. Strong, it can withstand more turmoil.</p>
      <p>A rapid change of the human mind takes place during puberty. Over a couple years, it matures significantly. The
        dominant drive for action changes from emotion to ration. Although maintaining similarity to the childhood
        state, the structure does go through a remodeling that allows changes to encroach. Most parents support this
        stage positively by encouraging positive behavior, allowing healthy risk-taking, and staying connected.
        Sometimes, some negative alterations ingress leading to mental health issues. The young human begins to enter
        its final form.</p>
      <p>A couple more years and the last bit of mental growth is sealed in at conclusion of young adulthood. With a
        robust support network, adults can handle almost any conflict whilst protecting the warmth of life inside. The
        purpose of that warm life becomes an overshadowing question. What is the reason for spending decades developing
        into adulthood? The question is as old as thought itself. Stoics will say to be free from suffering. Hedonists
        maximize pleasure. Nihilists argue life has no meaning. With millions of years to process, Deep Thought<sup><a
            href="#cite-note-9" id="cite-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> calculated 42. Numerous philosophers have tried to find a
        universal solution without success. As a lifetime is a mere speck on the cosmic timeline, life is meaningless:
        the earth continues to spin with or without human life.</p>
      <p>Everyone is unique due to their genealogy, rearing, experiences, etc. Each person must give their own life
        meaning in their own unique way. Being social creatures, sharing one’s life with others is often a fundamental
        component. With the freshly baked bread, share a slice with friends. They eat, they like, they praise. Share
        some more. Each time the loaf shrinks, but in good company rejoice. Eventually the loaf is reduced to the last
        heel, then nothing. Some crumbs and memories are all that is left to remind of its presence.</p>
      <p>Had the loaf been waiting to be consumed, had no one been offered a delicious slice, it would begin to grow
        stale. Hardening into a rock, it is inedible. Further disgrace invites colonies of spores to take hold. Marking
        their territory in fuzzy green patches. At first sight of the invaders, the loaf is destined to the compost. All
        is lost. Bread is quick to replace. Bake some more and perfect technique. Life isn’t as repeatable. Give life
        meaning, love each other, and bake some bread<sup><a href="#cite-note-10" id="cite-ref-10">[10]</a></sup>.</p>

      <h4>Notes</h4>

        <li><a href="#cite-ref-1" id="cite-note-1">^</a> I recommend Fleischmann’s original. They were the first to
          produce active dry yeast in World War II. The yeast cells are partially dehydrated and can survive on the
          shelf for months without being refrigerated. The warm water rehydrates them from their dormant state.</li>
        <li><a href="#cite-ref-2" id="cite-note-2">^</a> Depending on various factors, including humidity, more flour
          may need to be added to create the dough.</li>
        <li><a href="#cite-ref-3" id="cite-note-3">^</a> The dough should clean the bowl, attaching itself to any
          leftover liquid or flour.</li>
        <li><a href="#cite-ref-4" id="cite-note-4">^</a> Studies have found the optimal temperature to be between 24° C
          and 26° C.</li>
        <li><a href="#cite-ref-5" id="cite-note-5">^</a> Or until golden brown. Total baking time ranges from 25-45
          minutes.</li>
        <li><a href="#cite-ref-6" id="cite-note-6">^</a> If the sound is muffled and dampened, bake for another five
          minutes.</li>
        <li><a href="#cite-ref-7" id="cite-note-7">^</a> Usually this bond condition is dependent on the mortality of
          both parties as loss is a powerful emotion that is difficult to remove without removal of thought itself.</li>
        <li><a href="#cite-ref-8" id="cite-note-8">^</a> Modern linkage points to British Philosopher John Locke, often

          brownies, cake, cookies, croissants, custard, or just about anything. The provided recipe is for a lean dough
          rather than an enriched dough with high fat content. The higher fat leads to a denser dough with super soft
          interior and a gentler crust (think cinnamon rolls). Both are delicious and worth experimentation.</li>
