    <h1 class="text-title">About Me</h1>
    <p>The name is Davis, Bradley L. Davis. I like building satellites and robots, watching movies, playing boards
      games, and cooking. I sometimes take photos and videos, as well.</p>
    <img class="left lazy" alt="Drawn self portrait of Bradley Davis" title="Self portrait" src="portrait_lazy.png">
    <p>Currently at Washington State University, <i>Go Cougs!</i>, I am studying Electrical Engineering. My portfolio
      contains many circuit boards mainly for CougSat-1. It is a nanosatellite I am leading the engineering efforts
      for in WSU’s <i>Cougs in Space</i>. The electronics work is mainly embedded microcontroller systems with
      occasional radio frequency components. Part of my role in the club is providing systems engineering to manage
      the vast complexities that is a satellite.</p>
    <p>I am also a software engineer. With building microcontroller systems, comes the obligatory software. I often
      help design, implement, test, and review this code. The most exciting software I have written (and still am
      writing) for Cougs in Space is the software defined radio. At my internship at Schweitzer Engineering
      Laboratories, I created gigabit ethernet burden software as well as many automation scripts.</p>
    <p>Many years ago, I participated in FIRST Robotics Challenge in which I led a team of mechanical designers and
      CADers to create a human-sized robot in less than six weeks. The programmers, electricians, machinist, and
      fabricators wanted to have a couple weeks to do their thing; furthermore, high school has a thing called
      “homework” and “sleep”, so actual design duration was much shorter. If you want to check out my professional
      work or club contributions, head over to my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>. For my personal projects, visit
      my <a href="/lab">laboratories</a>.</p>
    <p>Outside of class, work, and projects, I enjoy spending time with my friends. With that comes watching countless
      movies, binging series, baking and indulging in chocolaty goods, and playing games. Ooh, and cooking. From tator
      tot casserole to smoked salmon to mac and cheese with Cougar Gold, I make it all. When I have time, traveling is
      fun too.</p>
    <p>My main drive for life is my continued exploration of valuable knowledge, exciting experiences, and innovative
      ideas. In every activity, I push the boundaries of myself and the topic.</p>
