      <h2 class="text-title">About Me</h2>
      <img src="images/portrait.png" class="float-left">
      <p>The name is Davis, Bradley L. Davis. I like building satellites and robots, watching movies, playing boards
        games, and cooking. I sometimes take photos and videos, as well.</p>
      <p>Currently at Washington State University, <i>Go Cougs!</i>, I am studying Electrical Engineering. My portfolio
        contains many circuits boards mainly for CougSat-1. It is a nanosatellite I am leading the engineering efforts
        for in WSU’s <i>Cougs in Space</i>. The electronics work is mainly embedded microcontroller systems with
        occasional radio frequency components. Part of my role in the club is providing systems engineering to manage
        the vast complexities that is a satellite.</p>
      <p>I am also a software engineer. With building microcontroller systems, comes the obligatory software. I often
        help design, implement, test, and review this code. The most exciting software I have written (and still am
        writing) for Cougs in Space is the software defined radio. At my internship at Schweitzer Engineering
        Laboratories, I created gigabit ethernet burden software as well as many automation scripts.</p>
      <p>Many years ago, I participate in FIRST Robotics Challenge in which I led a team of mechanical designers and
        CADers to create a human-sized robot in less than six weeks. The programmers, electricians, machinist, and
        fabricates wanted to have a couple weeks to do their thing; furthermore, high school has a thing called
        “homework” and “sleep”, so actual design duration was much shorter. If you want to check out my professional
        work or club contributions, head over to my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>. For my personal projects, visit
        my <a href="/lab">laboratories</a>.</p>
      <p>Outside of class, work, and projects, I enjoy spending time with my friends. With that comes watching
        countless movies, binging series, baking and indulging in chocolaty goods, and playing games. Ooh, and
        cooking. From tator tot casserole to smoked salmon to mac and cheese with Cougar Gold, I make it all. When I
        have time, traveling is fun too.</p>
      <p>My main drive for life is my continued exploration of valuable knowledge, exciting experiences, and innovative
        ideas. In every activity, I push the boundaries of myself and the topic.</p>
